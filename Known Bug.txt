Known Bugs:

CompletionScoreRatios need to be come out as string of values so as to be drawable from the first. Right now only one value at a time. The code is generally right, this just needs to be fixed when loading the item. - Explain this as restarting your session in the mean time.

Dates between goals and measures not synchronized. Dates in measures should only be valid between start and end date for goals. Dates in goals are unlimited 

Bar graph doesn't look exactly right, need to move things up a bit and add x and y axis.

Start and End dates and Current Value start as null. They need to start as their actual values.

App will crash if the database operations on the log in page aren't just right. Need to pay more attention to those.

Adding same person twice from any organisation will make it so the signup page isn't found. Need to fail more gracefully.
