Known Bugs:
Items need to be deletable

Perspectives need composite keys with organisation.
Goals need composite keys with perspectives and organisation.
Measures need composite keys with goals, perspectives and organisation.

CompletionScoreRatios need to be come out as string of values so as to be drawable from the first. Right now only one value at a time. The code is generally right, this just needs to be fixed when loading the item.

Dates between goals and measures not synchronized. Dates in measures should only be valid between start and end date for goals. Dates in goals are unlimited 

Bar graph doesn't look exactly right, need to move things up a bit and add x and y axis.
